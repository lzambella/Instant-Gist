# Instant-Gist
Quickly upload public or private gists with Visual Studio 2015.

## Usage
1. Create a personal access token in your user settings and allow gist uploads
2. Copy the key into the authentication settings window under the new gist menu option.
3. The program then should work. To upload a gist, just select some text in the editor and click gist->upload public/private gist.

## Todo:
1. Haven't tested what would happen if text was selected in multiple windows.
2. Add a shortcut in the editor context menu.
3. Replace messagebox with tooltip when gist has been successfully uploaded.
